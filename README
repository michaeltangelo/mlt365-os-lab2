		|- README
		|- makefile - for compilation running and management. Instructions below

# Usage:
# 	From any terminal:
#
# 	> cd mlt365-lab02
#
# 	> make 			-- this will compile all the Java programs in src.
# 				   Note that all the .class files will be put
# 				   in a folder called "bin".  If bin does not
# 				   exist, it will first create bin.
# 	> make run		-- this will run the main program: (Avoid! There MUST be an argument for textfile name)
# 	> make run args="file_path.txt"
# 				-- this will run the main program 
# 				   with the indicated command line arguments
#				-- the args indication the file name should be "file_path/file_name.txt"
#				-- i.e if input-4.txt is in jd2774-lab01 -> 'make run args="input-4.txt" '
#				-- i.e if it's in a folder in jd2774-lab01 called data -> 'make run args="data/input-4.txt"'
#	> make clean		-- removes any compiled programs (cleans bin folder)
#	> make zip		-- creates the zip file jd2774-lab01.zip for submission
#				   (the zip file will be found in the parent folder,
#				   i.e., "..")
